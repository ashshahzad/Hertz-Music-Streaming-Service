## Organization Introduction

Hertz, a music streaming service, is an online platform that allows users to listen to music over the internet without having to download the files. Users can access a vast library of songs, albums, and playlists through dedicated apps or web browsers on various devices. These services offer personalized recommendations and both free/paid subscription options. It is convenient, with on-demand access, and a wide range of content.

## Problem of Organization

Music streaming services are becoming increasingly popular as a means of acquiring and consuming music. With millions of subscribers accessing these platforms daily, a robust and scalable database management system is essential for storing and managing the vast amounts of data generated by these users. A well-designed DBMS can ensure efficient and effective data management, allowing for high performance and responsiveness.

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites

- A MySQL database or any other SQL database management system.
- SQL client tool to run the SQL scripts.

### Steps to Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ashshahzad/Hertz-Music-Streaming-Service.git
   cd Hertz-Music-Streaming-Service
   ```

2. Create the database and tables:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE hertz_music_streaming;
   USE hertz_music_streaming;

   /* Run the provided SQL scripts for table creation and data insertion */
   SOURCE create_tables.sql;
   SOURCE insert_data.sql;
   ```

3. Verify the database setup by running some queries:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM USERS;
   SELECT * FROM ALBUMS;
   ```
